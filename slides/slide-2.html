<h2>Buttons and calls to action</h2>

<h1>BIG</h1>
<h1>IS</h1>
<h1>Better</h1>

<p>
  Definitely go 44px or higher
</p>

<aside class="notes">
  How many is too many? Studies have showed that 1 clear call to action is actually better than 4 smaller ones.

  I wouldn't go higher than two...

  Thumb use.
